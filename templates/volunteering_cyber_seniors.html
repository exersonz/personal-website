            I'm proud to have been recognized as the <strong>June Volunteer of the Month</strong> 
            for my work with Cyber Seniors! This organization helps seniors learn and navigate 
            technology, bridging the digital divide and empowering older adults to connect 
            with their families and communities.
        </p>

            Through one-on-one sessions and group workshops, I help seniors learn how to use 
            smartphones, tablets, computers, and various apps. It's incredibly rewarding to see 
            their confidence grow as they master new skills and discover the possibilities 
            that technology offers.
